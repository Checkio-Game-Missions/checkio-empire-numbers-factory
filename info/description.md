For this mission, you are given the number **N** (which will be comprised of at least two digits). 
You must work to find the smallest positive number of **X** such that the product of its digits is equal to N.
If X does not exist, then you should return 0.

Let's look at an example. N = 20. We can factorize this number as 2\*10, but 10 is not a digit.
Also we can factorize it as 4\*5 or 2\*2\*5. The smallest number for 2\*2\*5 is 225, for 4\*5 -- 45. So we select 45.
