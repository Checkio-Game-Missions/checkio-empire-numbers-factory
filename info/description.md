You are given a two or more digits number **N**.
For this mission, you should find the smallest positive number of **X**,
such that the product of its digits is equal to N.
If X does not exist, then return 0.

Let's examine the example. N = 20. We can factorize this number as 2\*10, but 10 is not a digit.
Also we can factorize it as 4\*5 or 2\*2\*5. The smallest number for 2\*2\*5 is 225, for 4\*5 -- 45. So we select 45.
